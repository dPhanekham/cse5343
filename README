chell
Derek Phanekham

chell is a shell written in c and sometimes c is also hellish, hence chell.

The allowed commands are as follows

type <filename>
copy <filename1> <filename2>
delete <filename>
exit | quit

programs can be executed in the same manner as the bash shell.
So if they are executed using 

./filename

the same thing applies in this instance
